							<img src="images\hands.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right:15px; margin-top:10px">Creating Futures is a non-profit and non-government organization primarily focusing in the IT and ITES sector. It aims to create employment opportunities for the educated rural and urban youth from needy and economically under-privileged background by employing them and providing them with real-life experiences, as well as training them in various skills to make them highly capable corporate-ready resources. This initiative includes:</p>
							<div id="list">
								<ul>
									<li>Technology-based project experience and training</li>
									<li>Soft-skill training and development</li>
									<li>End-to-End software development lifecycle program</li>

								<img src="images\cycles.jpg" style="float:left; margin-top:10px;margin-right:15px; vertical-align:bottom">There are a large number of students graduating each year from various colleges.  Close to 30% of these students are engineers. Of these 40% of them do not get employment in the year after they graduate. These high levels of unemployment lead to poverty, which in turn creates a cycle of debt. The reason: colleges being academically-oriented, do not focus on the skills required to perform efficiently in a corporate environment. It is students from rural areas and those from under-privileged economic background who are most affected due to their lack of exposure to the enhanced skills that companies look for.  Some such skills required in the IT sector today include:</br>
								<div id="list">
									<ul>
										<li>Good communication skills</li>
										<li>Business awareness</li>
										<li>Interpersonal skills</li>
										<li>Planning and organizing</li>
										<li>Analytical skills</li>
										<li>Delivery excellence </li>
										<li>Ability to think critically</li>
										<li>Ability to work productively in a team</li>
